Hello everybody, this is Eder.

Recentely, I made this board thinking how to use the power of DiscoveryF0, making interesting projects using wireless modules, display LCD, driver circuits, etc.

Actually, this is a kind of Shield, but for DiscoveryF0 kits, but don't worry, because this is Open Hardware project and you can reproduce or improve everything you see here. Futhermore, if you don't have condition or time to do or reproduce this board, you can use the BSP with your kit that I have released, so check this out!

Enjoy :)
